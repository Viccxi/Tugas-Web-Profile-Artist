      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Ovic — known as <strong>Viccxi</strong>. I'm an independent artist driven purely by passion for music. I create because it’s in my heart, and I hope my songs resonate with the people who hear them.</p>

      <p>I started my music journey in <strong>2021</strong> with my debut single <em>"Hey See Me"</em>. From that point on, I’ve kept creating, growing, and evolving. Every aspect of my songs — from the <strong>lyrics</strong>, <strong>arrangement</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, <strong>beatmaking</strong>, to <strong>mixing and mastering</strong> — has been done entirely by me. This is my craft, and I pour my soul into every piece.</p>

      <p>Between 2021 and 2025, I’ve released <strong>four singles</strong> as a solo artist and one collaboration single with the band Bitternight, titled <em>"Lepaskan"</em>. I do all of this without any financial return, but I keep going — because music is who I am.</p>

      <p>I’m beyond grateful for everyone who has supported me, listened to my music, and walked with me on this journey. Your presence means the world to me. And no matter what, I will keep creating.</p>

      <p>– Viccxi</p>
